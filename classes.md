## WiFi-enabled wake-up lamp workshop, Friday April 23 at 7:30pm.

Join us for this workshop on making your own WiFi-controlled LED wake-up lamp. Based on the popular ESP32 microcontroller and a strip of RGB LEDs, this workshop will walk you through the steps of creating a light based alarm clock. This is an online event. Supplies should be purchased from our materials list below prior to the event. This lamp can be used for a number of IoT projects that use full-color programmable LEDs.
