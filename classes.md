The Rhode Island Maker Mill physical space remains closed due to the Coronavirus and Covid-19. We will consider reopening for meetings and classes once Phase 2 of the Rhode Island government's [Reopening RI](https://www.reopeningri.com/) plan goes into effect.

Until then we are holding virtual classes on certain Wednesday and Friday nights. Keep an eye on our social media on [Facebook](), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RIMakerMill), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ri_mm/) for future updates.

Stay safe.
