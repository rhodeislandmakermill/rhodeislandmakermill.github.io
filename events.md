The Rhode Island Maker Mill physical space remains closed due to the Coronavirus and Covid-19. We will consider reopening for meetings and classes once Phase 2 of the Rhode Island government's [Reopening RI](https://www.reopeningri.com/) plan goes into effect. 

Until then the members still meet virtually on Wednesday and Friday nights during our regular open hours. If you'd like an invite or have any questions reach out to us at info@rimakermill.com.

Keep an eye on this website or our social media on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OceanStateMakerMill), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RIMakerMill), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ri_mm/) for future updates.

Stay safe.
